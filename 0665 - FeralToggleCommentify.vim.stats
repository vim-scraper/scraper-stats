commit SHA1SHA1SHA1 (tag: refs/tags/1.54)
Author:     Robert KellyIV <feral@eclecticwizard.com>
AuthorDate: Sat Jul 12 00:00:00 2003 +0000
Commit:     Able Scraper <scraper@vim-scripts.org>

    Version 1.54
    
    2 BUG FIXes, 2 Improvements:
    * BUG FIX: (minor) no longer complains when uncommenting and there are no comment char(s). (aka middle of a range is uncommented already)
    * BUG FIX: Respects 'hlsearch'; won't mess with highlighting if off, etc. (Previous turned it on at end of script)
    * Improvement: Can now comment/uncomment a fold without opening it.  (courtesy of normal! zn and normal! zN)
    * Improvement: Changed DLAC into a proper command (:DLAC) (from mapping); map <Plug>FtcDLAC as desired, defaults to <C-c>. Ranges are supported (default current line) and you can specify the comment chars just as you can with :CC, :TC, :UC.
