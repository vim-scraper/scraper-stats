    Version 1.6
    
    Added one new feature: When you use :BlogSend, your default browser will open either the preview URL or the actual URL in your default browser (I have not tested this in Windows). If it is a published post, it will use the "?p=id" URL format. Note that this doesn't affect how you have your wordpress default URL slug setup.
    
    You can configure the plugin to not open a browser window by changing the enable_preview setting to 0. Currently, it will open a new window/tab everytime you do :BlogSend. I hope to modify this to only do it once per post in the future.
    
    I also now show the appropriate url in the Preview line based on whether it is a draft or published post.

    Version 1.5
    
    I added the capability to auto-complete categories. The command, while in insert mode, is <leader>c. This is the same as <ctrl>x <ctrl>u for a user defined auto-complete list.
    
    I also added some plugin checks to make sure it wasn't previously loaded.

    Version 1.2
    
    Bug Fix.
    Added the ability to define an image template to use. This template is inserted into the buffer after the :BlogUp has uploaded your image. %s is replaced with the img url. This should speed up time for inserting images into your posts.
