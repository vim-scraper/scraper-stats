    1.1:  Added ability for different filetypes to have their own set of stored
    registers.  Note that if a filetype has explicit registers set, it does NOT
    automatically also get localized storage of the global ones -- they have to
    be explicitly included in the local version (setup through the call to
    Setfiletyperegisters).  Suggested by Keith Roberts.
